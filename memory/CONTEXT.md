# memory/ - CONTEXT

## Purpose

Durable, cross-session memory for CenterOS. This folder lives inside the repo so it travels with the project and remains visible to future AI sessions.

This is where Jarvis writes and reads durable information about working with Thomas: feedback, references, user profile details, project context, decisions, and why-we-did-it notes.

## Contents

```text
CONTEXT.md       -- this file
LOG.md           -- append-only log of memory changes
MEMORY.md        -- the index. Always load this at session start.

feedback_*.md    -- corrections and validated approaches Thomas has given Jarvis
reference_*.md   -- facts, canonical spellings, and pointers to external systems
user_*.md        -- information about Thomas's role, goals, preferences, and knowledge
project_*.md     -- ongoing initiatives, decisions, deadlines, and motivations
```

Not every memory type needs to exist immediately. The naming pattern makes it simple to add files later.

## Usage / Trigger Conditions

Read `MEMORY.md` at the start of every session in this repo. Pull individual memory files only when their topics become relevant.

Write a new memory when:

- Thomas gives corrective feedback, especially repeated feedback.
- Thomas confirms a non-obvious approach worked.
- A durable fact about Thomas, their work, family, tools, or preferences surfaces.
- A durable project decision is made that would be non-obvious to future sessions.

Do not write a memory for:

- Ephemeral task state.
- Something derivable from current files or logs.
- Duplicates of existing memories.
- Secrets, credentials, API keys, private addresses, or sensitive personal material.

## Inputs

- Jarvis's running conversation with Thomas.
- Jarvis's observation of what Thomas corrects, validates, or leaves in place.

## Outputs

- New memory files in this folder.
- Updated `MEMORY.md` index with a new one-line pointer per file.
- Appended `LOG.md` entry documenting the change.

## Steps For Writing A Memory

1. Check for duplicates in `MEMORY.md` and this folder.
2. Write or update the relevant memory file with the correct type in frontmatter.
3. Update `MEMORY.md` with one line: `- [Title](file.md) -- one-line hook under 150 chars.`
4. Append an entry to `LOG.md`.

## Dependencies

- `../CLAUDE.md` - project-level operating rules.
- `../AGENTS.md` - project-level operating rules.
- `../BOOTSTRAP.md` - session-start reading order.
- `../PRINCIPAL.md` - durable user profile.
- `../SYSTEM_INDEX.md` - system index for workflows, wikis, and major components.

## Known Issues / Gotchas

- Do not write to per-user cache locations outside this repo. New memories belong in `memory/`.
- Treat this folder as synced project data. Do not store secrets or sensitive material here.
- `MEMORY.md` is the index, not the content. Keep individual memories in their own files.
