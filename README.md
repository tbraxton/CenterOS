`CenterOS` is a lightweight, cloneable operating system for working with AI.

It gives your AI a persistent home: instructions, memory, workflows, wikis, templates, and logs, all organized in plain Markdown files that live on your own computer.

The point is simple: stop starting from zero in every AI session. Give your AI a structured place to learn how you work, remember what matters, and build repeatable systems around your life or business.

### ⭐ If CenterOS is useful to you, star the repo

Stars help more people find the project and keep it moving. It takes one click.

## Install

You can install CenterOS by downloading the latest zip file or cloning the repo.

### Option 1: Download the zip

Download the latest release:

[Download CenterOS.zip](https://github.com/flatplanet/CenterOS/releases/latest/download/CenterOS.zip)

Unzip it on your computer, open the folder in your AI coding harness, and tell the AI:

```text
Read STARTUP.md and follow its instructions.
```

### Option 2: Clone the repo

Clone this repo to your computer, open it in your AI coding harness, and tell the AI:

```text
Read STARTUP.md and follow its instructions.
```

The AI will run the first-time setup, ask a short questionnaire, personalize the placeholder files, and leave you with your own AI operating system.

After setup, future sessions should start with:

```text
Read BOOTSTRAP.md and follow its instructions.
```

## What You Get

### Workflows

Repeatable procedures for anything you do more than once: writing, research, planning, content production, business operations, household admin, client work, or anything else you want to systematize.

Each workflow gets its own folder, context file, log, and optional workflow-scoped skills.

### Dashboard

A lightweight HTML/CSS dashboard shell for linking to workflow dashboard pages. Start with the default dashboard, then add pages under `dashboard/workflows/<workflow-name>/` as your workflows grow.

### Wikis

Structured knowledge bases for topics you care about. Put source material in `raw/`, let your AI synthesize pages in `wiki/`, and build a reference system that compounds over time.

### Memory

Durable project memory stored inside the repo. Your AI can remember preferences, decisions, context, and operating rules without depending on a vendor-specific hidden cache.

### Templates

Reusable scaffolding for creating new workflows and wikis consistently. The system favors boring, inspectable Markdown over complicated infrastructure.

### Logs

Append-only logs record meaningful system changes and workflow runs. You can always see what changed, when, and why.

## How It Works

CenterOS is built around a few simple files:

- `STARTUP.md` - one-time setup after cloning.
- `BOOTSTRAP.md` - every-session orientation.
- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` - operating rules for AI harnesses.
- `SOUL.md` - identity, purpose, voice, and behavioral principles.
- `PRINCIPAL.md` - the user's profile and working preferences.
- `SYSTEM_INDEX.md` - the internal map of the operating system.
- `memory/MEMORY.md` - the index of durable memories.

Everything is local, readable, and editable. No database required. No platform lock-in required.

---

## Why Use It

Most AI work disappears when the chat ends. CenterOS gives that work somewhere to live.

Use it when you want:

- A personal AI setup that survives across sessions.
- Repeatable workflows instead of one-off prompts.
- A knowledge base your AI can maintain with you.
- Clear rules for how your AI should act, write, and make decisions.
- A repo you can inspect, version, fork, and improve.

---

## First Workflow

After startup, the AI will ask whether you want to create your first workflow.

Describe what you want the workflow to do in plain language. For example:

```text
Create a workflow that turns a raw meeting transcript into a cleaned summary, action items, and follow-up email.
```

CenterOS will scaffold the workflow, document its inputs and outputs, and keep it consistent with the rest of the system.

To use the workflow later, start a normal session and tell your AI what you want to run:

```text
Run the meeting-summary workflow on this transcript.
```

Replace `meeting-summary` with your workflow folder name and provide whatever input the workflow expects. The AI will follow the documented steps, produce the output, and append the required workflow log entry.

---

## Design Principles

- Plain files first.
- Relative paths only.
- One concept per directory.
- Every important directory explains itself with `CONTEXT.md`.
- Every active component keeps an append-only `LOG.md`.
- Deterministic work should be handled by code whenever practical.
- AI judgment should be reserved for the parts that actually need judgment.

## Status

CenterOS is early and intentionally lightweight. It is meant to be cloned, personalized, and adapted.
